**Data Cleaning Report**


**Introduction**

Effective data management is crucial for accurate analysis and decision-making. To improve the quality of our dataset, several data cleaning and transformation techniques were applied. This report summarizes the steps taken to refine the data and the outcomes achieved.


**Methodology**

The following procedures were employed to process the dataset:

**Text to Columns**: Split data into separate columns based on delimiters to organize information more clearly.

**Remove Duplicates**: Eliminated redundant entries to ensure uniqueness using the 'Remove Duplicates' feature and 'unique' formula.

**Proper Case Conversion:** Standardized text capitalization by applying the 'Proper' function.

**Trim Function:** Removed unnecessary spaces from text fields using the 'Trim' function.

**Flash Fill:** Automated the separation of combined data elements like city and country.

**Percentage Formatting:** Converted numeric values to percentage format for better interpretation.

**Text to Values Conversion:** Transformed text-based numbers into numeric values for calculation purposes.

**Blank Cell Removal:** Deleted blank cells to streamline the dataset.


**Results**

The data processing steps resulted in:

**Consistent Formatting:** Uniform capitalization and elimination of extraneous spaces.

**Unique Records:** Removal of duplicate entries improved data accuracy.

**Organized Data:** Effective separation of combined fields and proper formatting of percentages.

**Clean Dataset:** Removal of blank cells ensured a more focused and usable dataset.


**Conclusions**

The applied data cleaning and transformation techniques successfully enhanced the dataset's quality. The improvements made ensure more accurate analysis and reliable results.
